<h2><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/set-in-python-ii/1?page=2&sortBy=accuracy">Set in Python - II</a></h2><h3>Difficulty Level : Difficulty: Easy</h3><hr><div class="problems_problem_content__Xm_eO"><p><span style="font-size: 18px;">This is the last practice question of Python Set. You are familiar with working on the set in Python. Now, let's move on to work on two sets using some inbuilt functions which are used widely. They are:<br><strong>union</strong>(): Used to find union() between two sets. It performs this using '|' operator.<br><strong>intersection</strong>(): Used to find intersection() between two sets. It performs this using '&amp;' operator.<br><strong>difference</strong>(): Difference of A and B (A - B) is a set of elements that are only in A but not in B. Similarly for B - A holds the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Now, Given some elements in two sets <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, the task is to find the elements common in two sets, elements in both the sets, elements that are only in set <strong>a</strong>, not in <strong>b</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Example:</strong></span></p>
<pre><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Input:</strong></span>
<span style="font-size: 18px;">a = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</span>
<span style="font-size: 18px;">b = {6, 7, 8, 2, 3}</span>
<span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Output:</strong></span>
<span style="font-size: 18px;">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8</span>
<span style="font-size: 18px;">2 3</span>
<span style="font-size: 18px;">1 4 5</span></pre>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;"><strong>Your Task:</strong><br>Your task is to complete the function <strong>all_in_set()</strong>, <strong>common_in_set()</strong> and <strong>diff()</strong> to perform union, intersection and difference between two sets and return the elements in the set after each operation.</span></p>
